# [About me](/about)

![portrait](/images/mbq_bw.jpg){: .align-right}

{: .text-justify}
I am a PhD student in computational science and a software engineer dedicated to advancing high-performance computing, particularly in the field of multi-physics simulations with a focus on plasma physics. My research combines theoretical "pen-and-paper" work with large-scale supercomputer simulations to tackle complex scientific problems. I am developing innovative software architectures that not only manage the intricacies of plasma simulations but are also versatile enough to be applied across a range of scientific domains. By incorporating modern AI and machine learning techniques, I aim to transform predictive modeling and data-driven optimization, pushing simulations toward greater accuracy and efficiency.

{: .text-justify}
My work bridges traditional computational methods and AI-driven approaches to make simulations faster, more scalable, and capable of extracting deeper insights from large datasets. I design advanced algorithms that harness modern supercomputers to address complex interactions in plasma environments, enhancing simulation accuracy and efficiency.

{: .text-justify}
Through my research, I aim to push the boundaries of what is possible in plasma simulations and contribute to the broader field of computational science by developing tools and methodologies that tackle some of the most complex and pressing problems we face today. Ultimately, my goal is to create a foundation upon which more accurate, faster, and versatile simulation frameworks can be built, driving innovation and discovery across multiple scientific disciplines.

Olen suomalainen astrofysiikan apulaisprofessori Helsingin yliopistossa. Tutkin pääasiassa suurenergia-astrofysiikan ääri-ilmiöitä, kuten neutronitähtien purkauksia, pulsarien säteilyä, mustien aukkojen kertymäkiekkoja, sekä kosmisia radiopurskeita.
