I've been teaching the introduction to UNIX section (as part of "Introduction to workstations for physicists") for couple of times now at the university.
My teaching material that is heavily exercise oriented is freely available from [github](https://github.com/natj/unix-intro).

Extra points for those who recognize the bunny!
