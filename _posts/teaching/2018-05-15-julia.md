My lecture material for the CSC (IT Center of Science in Finland) course on Julia is available freely on [csc-training repository](https://github.com/csc-training/julia-introduction).

Julia is a new emerging high-level, high-performance programming language. It aims to be simple to write and fast to run. In this course, we will introduce the basic concepts of programming with Julia. We will also discuss selected Julia packages and give an introduction to the Julia ecosystem. The course contains both lectures and hands-on exercises. All the material is provided as interactive notebooks.

The course is aimed for everybody with beginner to intermediate level of skills in programming.
